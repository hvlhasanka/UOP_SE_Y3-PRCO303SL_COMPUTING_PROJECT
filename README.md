## GHD COVID19 - Contact Tracing using A.I. and Disease Control Management System

GHD COVID19 is an infrastructure that consists of two web apps and a mobile app in the client-side. And one server-side application with two additional microservices. This service allows the public users to identify the possibility of an exposure to covid19, and allow the government health department to be notified. <br/>
Public users will be notified if they had come into contact with an infected individual within the past two weeks.
